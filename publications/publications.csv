We examined distribution in one of the most common salamanders in southeastern Michigan, the Blue-spotted Salamander (Ambystoma laterale-jeffersonianum unisexual complex). Three major tree species dominate the sub-canopy in the study site and form monospecific patches, which may have an effect on the distribution of terrestrial phases of local amphibian species. To examine this, we tested whether adult salamanders are significantly associated negatively or positively with patches of particular tree species. We then examined two potential causal factors: habitat quality, using leaf litter macroinvertebrate biomass as a proxy, and behavioral site choice in the Blue-spotted Salamander. We found that this species is positively associated with patches of red maple and negatively associated with patches of black cherry. We also found that, when presented with a choice, salamanders choose red maple leaf litter over black cherry leaf litter. In the absence of differences in physical leaf litter characteristics between patches of red maple and black cherry, we suggest that the Blue-spotted Salamander may be utilizing chemical cues to select habitat. Our findings imply that salamander populations may be affected not only by habitat loss, but also by changes in forest composition. These results provide evidence for a more complex model than the traditional amphibian metapopulation concept, where even fully forested habitat may form a matrix of optimal and sub-optimal, or even intolerable, patches.","2013-07","2017-10-08 03:26:37","2026-02-14 22:37:23","","254-261","","2","2013","","","","","","","","","","","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/3GEBDT6W/Belasen et al_2013_Effect of Sub-Canopy on.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatial distribution of the nests of Azteca sericeasur, a keystone tropical arboreal ant, is thought to form endogenous spatial patterns among the shade trees of a coffee plantation through self-regulating interactions with controlling agents (i.e. natural enemies). Using inhomogeneous point process models, we found evidence for both types of processes in the spatial distribution of A. sericeasur. Each year's nest distribution was determined mainly by a density-dependent relationship with the previous year's lagged nest density; but using a novel application of a Thomas cluster process to account for the effects of nest clustering, we found that nest distribution also correlated significantly with tree density in the later years of the study. This coincided with the initiation of agricultural intensification and tree felling on the coffee farm. The emergence of this significant exogenous effect, along with the changing character of the density-dependent effect of lagged nest density, provides clues to the mechanism behind a unique phenomenon observed in the plot, that of an increase in nest population despite resource limitation in nest sites. Our results have implications in coffee agroecological management, as this system provides important biocontrol ecosystem services. Further research is needed, however, to understand the effective scales at which these relationships occur.","2016-05","2017-10-07 07:04:05","2017-10-08 04:39:10","","160073-160073","","5","3","","","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/GHHQNTAZ/Li, Vandermeer, Perfecto - 2016 - Disentangling endogenous versus exogenous pattern formation in spatial ecology a case study of the ant.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ecological drivers of oil palm pollination are still poorly understood, despite pollination being a key ecosystem service for the yield of this multi-billion-dollar industry, with potential links to biodiversity conservation. Here we review biotic and abiotic drivers of pollination and known oil palm pollinators, including local insect species endemic to specific growing regions, and an important, globally-introduced West African weevil (Elaeidobius kamerunicus) whose fluctuating populations have led to concerns about yield and resilience. Future research should clarify pollinator community dynamics to facilitate pollination complementarity, which may strengthen pollination services in regions beyond the oil palm and weevil’s native West African ecosystem. In addition, other interactions such as mutualism, predation, and parasitism are not yet well understood, but could provide further insight into population drivers. Future management research should explore manipulating male palm inflorescence density, a key resource for pollinators, as well as investigate spatial and landscape effects on pollinator populations. Critically, no studies have investigated the effects of climate change on pollination, despite the impacts of rain and temperature on pollination efficiency. A greater understanding of the role of pollinator species and their nonlinear relationships to yield, as well as the complexity of biotic, management, and climate drivers of successful pollination can contribute to a more sustainable oil palm production system that values ecosystem services gained from biodiversity, while also improving producer livelihoods.","2019-08-01","2019-05-08 14:21:56","2019-05-08 14:21:56","2019-05-08 14:21:56","152-160","","","280","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","Critical factors limiting pollination success in oil palm","","","","","","","","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/TKU9NNST/Li et al. - 2019 - Critical factors limiting pollination success in o.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/L3H2AZA9/S0167880919301240.html","","","Yield; Oil palm; Weevil; Land-use management; Fruit set; Pollen limitation; Pollinator complementarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Oil palm monocultures have been criticized because of their reduced biodiversity compared to the forests they historically replaced, and because of their negative impact on soils, water, and climate. We experimentally test whether less intensive management schemes may enhance biodiversity and lessen detrimental effects on the environment while maintaining high yields. We compare reduced versus conventional fertilization, as well as mechanical versus chemical weed control (with herbicides) in a long-term, full-factorial, multidisciplinary experiment. We conducted the experiment in an oil palm company estate in Sumatra, Indonesia, and report the results of the first two years. We measured soil nutrients and functions, surveyed above- and below-ground organisms, tracked oil palm condition and productivity, and calculated plantation gross margins. Plants, aboveground arthropods and belowground animals were positively affected by mechanical versus chemical weed control, but we could not detect effects on birds and bats. There were no detectable negative effects of reduced fertilization or mechanical weeding on oil palm yields, fine roots, or leaf area index; however, stem growth was enhanced under mechanical weeding. Also, we could not detect detrimental effects of the reduced fertilization and mechanical weeding on soil nutrients and functions (mineral nitrogen, bulk density, and litter decomposition), but water infiltration and base saturation tended to be higher under mechanical weeding, while soil moisture and microbial biomass varied with treatment. Economic performance, measured as gross margins, was higher under reduced fertilization. There might be a delayed response of oil palm to the different management schemes applied, so results of future years may confirm whether this is a sustainable management strategy. Nevertheless, the initial effects of the experiment are encouraging to consider less intensive management practices as economically and ecologically viable options for oil palm plantations.","2019","2020-04-17 14:54:28","2020-04-17 14:54:28","2020-04-17 14:54:28","","","","2","","Front.

Yet, for organisms living in that landscape, structure may be perceived very differently depending on the dispersal capacity of the organism of concern -- large animals may perceive a highly fragmented forest as a single patch if adjacent forest patches are sufficiently close, while small animals may be less likely to disperse across degraded habitat and therefore experience a much different patch structure. This is particularly relevant for fragmented landscapes like cities. Urban gardens are reputed to support a diversity of native and non-native urban species found in urban landscapes. Yet we know little about the long-term persistence of organisms associated with urban gardens. Here we utilize Taylor’s law, a universal scaling law denoting a power law relationship between population size and variance to indicate the synchrony of arthropod populations sampled across time in a fragmented urban landscape. Our results indicate that the utility of urban gardens as habitat is strongly dependent on sampling month, spatial scale and taxon. Constrained dispersal across the landscape may limit the potential of urban gardens to conserve natural enemies including ladybird beetles and parasitoid wasps. In contrast, aphid pests are moving much more freely in the landscape as exhibited through synchrony in abundances sampled across local and landscape scales. We find that regardless of the fragmentation pattern existing in the landscape, short-ranged arthropods are isolated to small, independent garden habitat patches (metapopulation-like) with abundances that oscillate out of sync, while long-ranged species traverse greater distances, synchronizing abundances across large, shared spaces (source sink-like). These results suggest an inherent link between Taylor’s temporal law and metapopulation theory, providing a potential mechanism to explain species-specific slopes of Taylor’s law as arising from the ability of organisms to differentially experience fragmented space along the continuum between metapopulation and source-sink.","2020","2020-04-15 12:09:12","2020-07-04 22:41:32","2020-04-15 12:09:12","","","","4","","Front.

Based on observations in an old field in Southeast Michigan spanning 35 years, our study documents significant impacts of habitat change, likely driven by the invasion of the shrub, Elaeagnus umbellata, on the nest distribution patterns and population demographics of a native ant species, Formica obscuripes. Landcover change in aerial photographs indicates that E. umbellata expanded aggressively, transforming a large proportion of the original open field into dense shrubland. By comparing the ant's landcover preferences before and after the invasion, we demonstrate that this species experienced a significant unfavorable change in its foraging areas. We also find that shrub landcover significantly moderates aggression between nests, suggesting nests are more related where there is more E. umbellata. This may represent a shift in reproductive strategy from queen flights, reported in the past, to asexual nest budding. Our results suggest that E. umbellata may affect the spatial distribution of F. obscuripes by shifting the drivers of nest pattern formation from an endogenous process (queen flights), which led to a uniform pattern, to a process that is both endogenous (nest budding) and exogenous (loss of preferred habitat), resulting in a significantly different clustered pattern. The number and sizes of F. obscuripes nests in our study site are projected to decrease in the next 40 years, although further study of this population's colony structures is needed to understand the extent of this decrease. Elaeagnus umbellata is a common invasive shrub, and similar impacts on native species might occur in its invasive range, or in areas with similar shrub invasions.","2017","2017-10-07 07:15:05","2020-07-04 17:00:24","2020-07-04 16:59:48","2250-2261","","6","23","","","From endogenous to exogenous pattern formation","","","","","","","en","© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.13671","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/XGYSATNJ/Li et al._2017_From endogenous to exogenous pattern formation Invasive plant species changes the spatial distribution of a native ant.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/TY86VRSV/gcb.html","","and; ann; environment; school of natural resources; university of michigan","Formica obscuripes; autumn olive; Elaeagnus umbellata; invasive species; landcover change; pattern formation; spatial distribution; thatching ant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This information is not only important for conservation efforts, but also has important implications for sustainable agricultural practices. Associated biodiversity can provide ecosystem services like pollination and pest control, but because organisms may respond differently to the unique environmental filters of specific urban landscapes, it is valuable to compare regions that have different abiotic conditions and urbanization histories. In this study, we compared the abundance and diversity of ladybird beetles within urban gardens in California and Michigan, USA. We asked what species are shared, and what species are unique to urban regions. Moreover, we asked how beetle diversity is influenced by the amount and rate of urbanization surrounding sampled urban gardens. We found that the abundance and diversity of beetles, particularly of unique species, respond in opposite directions to urbanization: ladybirds increased with urbanization in California, but decreased with urbanization in Michigan. We propose that in California water availability in gardens and the urbanization history of the landscape could explain the divergent pattern. Thus, urban context is likely a key contributor to biodiversity within habitats and an important consideration for sustainable agricultural practices in urban agroecosystems.","2018-06","2018-06-01 13:12:33","2021-12-06 17:58:57","2021-12-06 17:58:31","1829","","6","10","","","Context Matters","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www-mdpi-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu","","Number: 6","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/GGDHAAYG/Egerer et al. - 2018 - Context Matters Contrasting Ladybird Beetle Respo.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/ZRYVHEJG/Egerer et al. - 2018 - Context Matters Contrasting Ladybird Beetle Respo.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/2D9CS7KX/Egerer et al. - 2018 - Context Matters Contrasting Ladybird Beetle Respo.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/BH5PEXQ4/1829.html","","","biological control; California; impervious surface; Michigan; urban gardens; urbanization rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on monthly infection data from 128 study quadrats in a 45-ha plot in southern Mexico from 2014 to 2020, we find that the persistent seasonal epidemic following the initial outbreak collapses in an evident subsequent critical transition. Characteristic signals of “critical slowing down” precede this collapse and are correlated with reduced rainfall, as expected from climate change, and planting of rust-resistant varieties, an ongoing management intervention. Recoveries from catastrophes may themselves be experienced as a critical transition and managers should consider the larger dynamical landscape for the possibility of subsequent transitions.

In a field experiment in Sumatra, Indonesia, we manipulated floral visitor access to female oil palm inflorescences over a 100 m distance gradient from forest into oil palm and sampled insects with sticky traps placed above male and female inflorescences. Full exclusion of floral visitors decreased mean oil palm fruit set to 12%, demonstrating that insect pollination was necessary to maintain favorable fruit set and yield. Treatment group means of fruit set under open pollination (62%) and when excluding large (>1.4 mm diameter) organisms (72%), did not differ significantly from open pollination augmented with hand pollination (61%), suggesting no difference in pollen limitation. In contrast, when we examined change in fruit set with distance from forest, we found a significant trend of higher fruit set in oil palms closer to the forest when large organisms were excluded, which increased estimated fruit set at the forest edge to 87%, compared to open-pollinated palms (70%). This trend with distance from forest was absent when we fully excluded floral visitors, showing that the effect of forest was not likely due to an abiotic gradient (e.g., changing soil nutrients). Of the arthropod taxa collected from sticky traps, Drosophilidae (Diptera) and Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera) decreased and increased with distance from forest, respectively. The taxa Elaeidobius kamerunicus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Gelechiidae, and the families Thripidae and Phlaeothripidae (Thysanoptera) were abundant on both male and female inflores­ cence sticky traps. Elaeidobius kamerunicus, an introduced oil palm pollinator, had the only significant rela­ tionship with fruit set. Our results confirm pollination by insects as a key ecosystem service for oil palm production. Although further work is needed to clarify the relationship between fruit set, biodiversity, and distance from forest, we speculate that excluding large organisms could have increased fruit set closer to forest by mediating interactions between pollinators, forest predators, and farm mesopredators. Understanding the re­ lationships between nearby forest and pollination services could better connect oil palm production to its landscape context and associated biodiversity. This would be important for landscape-scale conservation plan­ ning that considers both the ecosystem service needs and ecological impacts of oil palm agriculture.","2022-10","2022-07-24 00:56:52","2022-07-24 00:56:52","2022-07-24 00:56:52","108108","","","338","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/RQYMZXR8/Li et al. - 2022 - Adjacent forest moderates insect pollination of oi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plant-pollinator interactions buffer the process of forest fragmentation, ensuring gene flow across isolated patches of forests by pollen transfer. In this study, we identified the composition of pollen grains stored in pot-pollen of stingless bees, Tetragonula laeviceps, via dual-locus DNA metabarcoding (ITS2 and rbcL) and light microscopy, and compared the taxonomic coverage of pollen sampled in distinct land-use systems categorized in four levels of management intensity (forest, shrub, rubber, and oil palm) for landscape characterization. Results:  Plant composition differed significantly between DNA metabarcoding and light microscopy. The overlap in the plant families identified via light microscopy and DNA metabarcoding techniques was low and ranged from 22.6 to 27.8%. Taxonomic assignments showed a dominance of pollen from bee-pollinated plants, including oil-bearing crops such as the introduced species Elaeis guineensis (Arecaceae) as one of the predominant taxa in the pollen samples across all four land-use types. Native plant families Moraceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Cannabaceae appeared in high proportion in the analyzed pollen material. One-way ANOVA (p > 0.05), PERMANOVA (R² values range from 0.14003 to 0.17684, for all tests p-value > 0.5), and NMDS (stress values ranging from 0.1515 to 0.1859) indicated a lack of differentiation between the species composition and diversity of pollen type in the four distinct land-use types, supporting the influx of pollen from adjacent areas. Conclusions:  Stingless bees collected pollen from a variety of agricultural crops, weeds, and wild plants. Plant composition detected at the family level from the pollen samples likely reflects the plant composition at the landscape level rather than the plot level. In our study, the plant diversity in pollen from colonies installed in land-use systems with distinct levels of forest transformation was highly homogeneous, reflecting a large influx of pollen transported by stingless bees through distinct land-use types. Dual-locus approach applied in metabarcoding studies and visual pollen identification showed great differences in the detection of the plant community, therefore a combination of both methods is recommended for performing biodiversity assessments via pollen identification.","2022-12","2022-08-05 13:36:12","2022-08-05 13:36:14","2022-08-05 13:36:10","51","","1","22","","BMC Ecol Evo","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/L6E82CTI/Carneiro de Melo Moura et al. - 2022 - Biomonitoring via DNA metabarcoding and light micr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, hierarchical models that consider variability in relationships among soil properties and As bioaccessibility across geographic locations and contaminant sources were developed to predict As bioaccessibility in 139 soils on both a mass fraction (mg/kg) and % basis. The hierarchical approach improved the estimation of As bioaccessibility in studied soils.

Four flight activities were observed, i.e., flying out of the nest, returning with pollen, returning without pollen, and returning with resin. In addition to the flight activity, we observed flight direction and environmental factors and identified pollen composition from the hind tibia of stingless bees. This study showed that forest fragments had the highest number of bees flying out of the nest. Bees returning with or without pollen in the fragmented forest with high coverage were higher than in other habitats. The highest number of bees returning with resin was found in the rubber plantation with high coverage, while the lowest number of all flight activities were observed in the shrub with low coverage. The stingless bees mainly collected pollen from rubber flowers supported by their flight directions leading to blooming rubber trees.

Consequently, the socioecological characteristics of the agricultural system influence the probability of zoonosis emergence. Here, we propose an approach to examining the relationship between agriculture and zoonoses that suggests that the agricultural matrix, within which other elements of the landscape are positioned, confers various degrees of landscape immunity. Highly simplified, homogeneous, and chemically intensive agricultural landscapes are unlikely to provide such immunity, while diverse agroecological matrices populated by small-/medium-scale farmers and a robust local food system likely will; i.e., they will decrease the probability of zoonosis emergence.

Here we experimentally verify that splash from leaf litter can lead to H. vastatrix dispersal and infection. In a semi-controlled experiment, we compared the infection rates of pairs of potted uninfected, susceptible C. arabica plants with leaf litter that was either infected with CLR (experimental treatment) or without CLR (control). Plants with CLR litter became infected sooner than control plants by a median difference of 2.5 weeks.

However, how tree enrichment affects insect-mediated ecosystem functions is unknown. We investigated impacts on insect herbivory and pollination in the fourth year of a plantation-scale, long-term oil palm biodiversity enrichment experiment in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia. Within 48 plots systematically varying in size (25–1600 m2) and planted tree species richness (one to six species), we collected response data on vegetation structure, understory insect abundances, and pollinator and herbivore activity on chili plants (Capsicum annuum), which served as indicators of insect-mediated ecosystem functions. We examined the independent effects of plot size, tree species richness, and tree identity on these response variables, using the linear model for random partitions design. The experimental treatments were most associated with vegetation structure: tree identity mattered, as the species Peronema canescens strongly decreased (by approximately one standard deviation) both canopy openness and understory vegetation cover; whereas tree richness only decreased understory flower density. Further, the smallest plots had the lowest understory flower density and richness, presumably because of lower light availability and colonization rates, respectively. Enrichment influenced herbivorous insects and natural enemies in the understory to a lesser extent: both groups had higher abundances in plots with two enrichment species planted, possibly because higher associated tree mortality created more habitat, while herbivores decreased with increasing tree species richness, in line with the resource concentration hypothesis. Linking relationships in structural equation models showed that the negative association between P. canescens and understory vegetation cover was mediated through canopy openness. Likewise, canopy openness mediated increases in herbivore and pollinator insect abundances. Higher pollinator visitation increased phytometer yield, while impacts of insect herbivores on yield were not apparent. Our results demonstrate that even at an early stage, different levels of ecological restoration influence insect-mediated ecosystem functions, mainly through canopy openness. These findings suggest that maintaining some canopy gaps while enrichment plots develop may be beneficial for increasing habitat heterogeneity and insect-mediated ecosystem functions.","2023","2023-11-16 15:30:51","2023-11-16 15:30:51","2023-11-16 15:30:51","e2862","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

Understanding how anthropogenic stressors affect the habitat quality of estuaries is a crucial component of fisheries conservation. A meaningful composite indicator for estuary stress on the nekton community at regional scales should encapsulate major anthropogenic effects over an assemblage of important species. This study introduces a composite stressor index, using meta-analysis to synthesize trawl and seine-based sampling data on 39 nekton species from 25 monitoring programs covering 38 Pacific Coast estuaries spanning four ecoregions. Candidate stressor variables include pollution sources, urban and agricultural land use, and stream impairments, considered at different spatial scales. For each of the 39 focal species, we screened these stressors using hierarchical statistical models that account for environmental variability (e.g., salinity) across sampling events and systematic biases due to monitoring program protocols and species-specific biogeographic ranges. Based on this screening, we identified a subset of stressors most strongly related to nekton presence/absence. Then we used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify major thematic axes of variation across these stressors and the 38 estuaries. Hierarchical nekton models fit to these axes (i.e., thematic stressors) indicate that urban development is negatively related to most nekton species, while agriculture is often positively related to species presence, though with smaller estimated effects. These models were also used to create the estuary-level composite index of anthropogenic stress. Urban development is the major contributor to the index scores of most estuaries, except in the Oregon-Washington Coast ecoregion, where agriculture is dominant. The composite index indicates that estuaries in the Southern California Bight ecoregion are the most impacted, along with South San Francisco Bay.","2023-10-01","2024-02-07 14:09:05","2024-02-07 14:09:05","2024-02-07 14:09:05","110678","","","154","","Ecological Indicators","","","","","","","","","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/X2MSJKB3/Li et al. - 2023 - An estuary stress index based on nekton relationsh.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/KUEN9JJB/S1470160X23008208.html","","","Meta-analysis; Estuaries; Hierarchical modeling; Nekton; Pollutants; Stressors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a lower-cost alternative to costly and specialized aircraft and associated equipment that are typically used in the study of spores and pollen in the atmosphere. Methods. We use 3D printable components and common lab supplies mounted on an uncrewed aircraft (UA). Conveniently, this setup does not require additional electronic components to control collection during flight, using the UA landing gear mechanism instead. Results. We demonstrate that this apparatus can collect fungal spores in the atmosphere and describe potential impacts for the environment and experimental protocol on collection efficiency. These include the effects of: 1) competing airflows from UA rotors, flight trajectories, and wind, 2) flight altitude, and 3) agar concentration of the collection medium. Conclusions. Complex biological mechanisms and atmospheric dynamics dictate the release, transport and deposition of bioaerosols.

With the combined utility of UASs and the attention on agroecosystems, there is an opportunity to assess UAS practicality in highly biodiverse settings. In this study, we utilized UASs to collect fine-resolution 10-band multispectral imagery of coffee agroecosystems in Puerto Rico. We created land cover maps through a pixel-based supervised classification of each farm and assembled accuracy assessments for each classification. The average overall accuracy (53.9%), though relatively low, was expected for such a diverse landscape with fine-resolution data. To bolster our understanding of the classifications, we interviewed farmers to understand their thoughts on how these maps may be best used to support their land management. After sharing imagery and land cover classifications with farmers, we found that while the prints were often a point of pride or curiosity for farmers, integrating the maps into farm management was perceived as impractical.

Landscape transformation caused by conversion to agriculture threatens habitats of wild pollinators, reducing their potential to provide ecosystem services. The landscape in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, is an example of a region undergoing landscape transformation, from biodiverse natural forests, to intermediate land uses such as fallow shrubland and jungle rubber, to monospecific oil palm plantations. My dissertation explores how transitions between these land uses impact pollinator biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. I consider different facets of this interface: the impacts of adjacent forest on pollination services to oil palm; mechanisms driving ecosystem functions and services following agroforestry enrichment within oil palm; and landscape-scale comparisons quantifying interacting local and landscape effects on a native pollinator species.    My first chapter reviews the state of the knowledge of oil palm pollination by insects. I conducted a systematic review of biotic and abiotic drivers of oil palm pollination and pollinator populations. I present the current understanding of the globally introduced West African Weevil (Elaeidobius kamerunicus), whose regional population fluctuations have negatively impacted yield and resilience, as well as other potential pollinator species endemic to particular growing regions. Based on my review, I describe specific issues concerning biotic, management, and climate drivers of pollination that should be the focus of future oil palm pollination research.    In my second chapter, I examine the role that natural habitat can play as a source of pollination ecosystem services and ecological spillover effects in an oil palm field experiment. I compared treatments controlling visitors and pollination of female oil palm inflorescences over a distance gradient from an adjacent forest border. I found that exclusion of all visitors significantly decreased fruit set compared to other treatments, confirming insect pollination is necessary for adequate yield. Forest proximity had a significant positive effect on fruit set when large visitors were excluded. This effect was not significant for treatments that minimized pollinator contributions, suggesting this trend was not due to abiotic factors. However, insect abundances associated with oil palm inflorescences were not strongly related to distance from forest, and only E. kamerunicus had a significant relationship with fruit set. These results could suggest that non-consumptive ecological spillover from forests may influence oil palm pollination, though more experimental work is needed to identify these interactions.     In my third chapter, I explore how enriching the oil palm agricultural matrix with up to six tree species played a role in driving insect-mediated ecosystem functions. Within a plantation-scale, long-term oil palm biodiversity enrichment project, I disentangled the direct and indirect effects of enrichment on services (pollination, biocontrol) and disservices (herbivory) using random partition analysis and structural equation models. These models indicate that changes in canopy openness, driven by enrichment treatments, played an important role in ecological patterns at multiple levels of interaction. These had effects on herbivorous insects and pollinators, the latter of which had a positive effect on the fruit production of phytometer plants (Capsicum annuum) placed in the plots. Our results show that, even in early stages of ecological restoration of oil palm, ecosystem functions and services can be affected. These effects are mediated by decreasing canopy openness; however, these relationships may change as enrichment communities continue to develop.    In my fourth chapter, I examine the counterbalancing roles of local land use and amount of landscape habitat in pollinator survival and growth, using the native stingless bee Tetragonula laeviceps as a focal species. I established three colonies in 40 plots within Jambi’s transformation landscape, selecting from four predominant habitat types (degraded primary forest, shrubland, rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation) and controlling for a gradient of natural habitat (i.e., forest and shrubland) composition in a 500 m radius. I found that hives with higher local flower species richness had more pollen stores, which in turn was associated with increased bee and colony size. Colonies in structurally complex habitats such as forest and rubber plantations had lower mortality and greater gains in hive size than colonies in open habitats such as oil palm and shrubland; however, open habitats had higher flower species richness and abundance. Open habitats, which are increasing with rainforest conversion, reduce suitable nesting habitat but may increase floral resources in the landscape. Considering the key pollinating function of stingless bees, understanding how this trade-off translates to landscape and population scales will be critical in light of the continued deforestation crisis in the tropics.    In summary, understanding and protecting the resources supporting pollination are critical to improving the sustainability of oil palm and can support the livelihoods of people living in the landscape. The impact of habitat loss from agriculture conversion can adversely impact wild pollinator populations through the loss of suitable habitats, as I observed with T. laeviceps, but also changes the flowering resource landscape. In my review of oil palm pollination, I show that a better understanding of biodiversity and landscape drivers of pollination of oil palm itself is needed. My own oil palm field experiment demonstrates how natural habitat and biodiversity may interact positively with oil palm production. I show in my experiments within the oil palm biodiversity enrichment project that tree biodiversity enrichment can indirectly influence pollination services and ecosystem functions, even at an early stage. However, the ecosystem services and disservices affected by ecological restoration will continue to change as the ecological community develops. Our task in future research will be to continue to disentangle these relationships with the aim of recovering or preserving biodiversity and ecosystem function while informing sustainable ecological strategies for farmers and land managers.","2022-09-27","2024-08-06 12:18:46","2025-04-24 16:31:34","2024-08-06 12:18:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Georg-August-Universität Göttingen","Göttingen, GERMANY","eng","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Doctoral Thesis","","","ediss.uni-goettingen.de","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/GFAMITWJ/Li - 2022 - Pollinators and Ecosystem Services in an Oil Palm .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The U.S. EPA established data quality objectives (DQOs) to support data collection used to estimate the EPC and assess confidence in remediation decisions. To support DQO processes at sites where site-specific soil Pb relative bioavailability (RBA) is assessed, a statistical simulation model was developed that estimates false compliance/exceedance decision error probabilities based upon uncertainty in the RBA-adjusted EPC, employing model inputs defining (1) the sampling protocol being evaluated, (2) variability in total and bioavailable soil Pb across the assessed area, and (3) analytical measurement uncertainty.

Chi-squared tests of coffee leaf rust and American leaf spot presence show significantly fewer coffee plants infected with both diseases and more plants infected with only one disease than at random. The resulting patterns of infection are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be trade-offs in controlling these pathogens, where the leaf rust-resistant Coffea arabica varieties planted in response to the recent outbreak may be more susceptible to American leaf spot disease.

Our criteria emphasize that models should be spatially explicit and quantify multiple agriculturally relevant ecosystem services, and ideally, they should be adaptable to livestock systems and annual and perennial crops. Models should also be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAiR). we synthesized 28 literature reviews that compared across multiple models, focusing on modeling frameworks that appeared consistently across reviews and matched most of our criteria. these models were integrated valuation of ecosystem Services and tradeoffs (inveSt), Artificial intelligence for ecosystem Services (ARieS), Soil and water Assessment tool (SwAt), and Social values for ecosystem Services (SolveS). we also included the Agricultural Policy/environmental eXtender (APeX) and the Rangeland Production Model (RPM) as examples of modeling frameworks that focus on ecosystem services in grazing lands, which are not well-represented in the reviewed literature. Most eSM tools include climate, soil, and water processes, while fewer models cover pollination, natural habitat, or cultural values, and none include biological pest control or genetic diversity. we find that the inveSt framework covers the greatest range of agroecosystem services and is automatable, open source, freely accessible, and easily applicable to landscapes, though it lacks integrated modules for modeling processes specific to grazing land. we identify components of inveSt that must be improved to provide meaningful results in grazed or integrated crop-livestock systems. the SolveS framework is unique in focusing on social and cultural values of ecosystem services, complementing the physical processes in inveSt. these models provide different, accessible options for understanding landscape management impacts on multiple ecosystem services and have the potential to play a key role in supporting decision-making in sustainable agriculture.","2025-10-28","2025-10-31 13:14:20","2025-10-31 13:14:40","2025-10-31 13:14:20","1-17","","","","","Journal of Soil and Water Conservation","","","","","","","","en","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/WGZ8JGF8/Li and Goslee - 2025 - Modeling tools for ecosystem service tradeoffs and synergies in agricultural landscapes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These systems are embedded in ecologically complex landscapes, central to global food security, and depend heavily on biodiversity-derived ecosystem services. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies assessing the relationship between distance to natural habitat and pollinator abundance, species richness, and crop fruit set in tropical smallholder farms. We found no consistent patterns in pollinator abundance and crop fruit set with increasing distance, with relationships highly variable across studies. Similarly variable, yet slightly negative, was the relationship between distance and pollinator species richness. Our findings suggest limited support for the ‘proximity to natural habitat’ hypothesis in tropical smallholder farms, indicating that the inherent complexity of these landscapes may buffer negative effects of distance on pollination. This underscores the importance of maintaining and restoring landscape complexity to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services such as crop pollination. We also highlight the need for greater methodological consistency and publicly available raw data in future studies to strengthen the evidence base and support management strategies for safeguarding pollination services in tropical smallholder farms.","2025","2025-12-05 21:59:55","2025-12-05 21:59:55","2025-12-05 21:59:55","e70229","","12","28","","","Proximity to Natural Habitat Is Not Consistently Associated With Pollination Services in Tropical Smallholder Farms","","","","","","","en","© 2025 The Author(s).

Coffee agroforests with high levels of shade and large trees can maintain diverse epiphyte communities, helping to buffer the loss of their native montane cloud forest habitat. While the impact of management on shade tree epiphytes has been investigated, less work has explored how general agricultural intensification impacts the community of epiphytes on coffee plants specifically, which may provide critical vegetative niche space on farms. Here we report results from a survey study, comparing the vascular epiphyte communities on coffee plants between two large farms of contrasting management – a low-input, high-shade organic polyculture, and a high-input, low-shade monoculture. We found that the shaded polyculture had significantly higher coffee epiphyte diversity, with nearly double the total number of species surveyed, an average of 76 % more species per coffee plant, and five times more orchid and bromeliad individuals. Communities between the farms were also distinct, with higher evenness in the shaded polyculture. Our assessment of potential farm management drivers revealed a positive impact of canopy cover and coffee height on epiphyte species richness and abundance, and a negative impact of the distance to the nearest forest patch on species richness in the shaded polyculture, illustrating the importance of understanding the effects of management at both the local and landscape scale. Overall, our results show how the diversity of epiphytes on coffee plants may be significantly reduced by coffee intensification practices and further demonstrate the potential for sustainable agroforestry management in biodiversity conservation. Spanish Abstract Los sistemas agroforestales desempeñan un papel importante en la conservación en regiones tropicales. Los cafetales con altos niveles de sombra y árboles de talle grande pueden mantener comunidades diversas de epífitas, lo que ayuda a mitigar la pérdida de su hábitat original en los bosques mesófilos de montaña. Si bien se ha investigado el impacto del manejo agroforestal sobre las epífitas de los árboles de sombra, se ha explorado menos cómo la intensificación agrícola en general afecta a la comunidad de epífitas presentes específicamente en las plantas de café, las cuales pueden proporcionar un hábitat crítico en las fincas. Aquí presentamos los resultados de un estudio comparativo, en el que se evaluaron las comunidades de epífitas vasculares en plantas de café en dos fincas grandes con manejos contrastantes: un policultivo orgánico con bajos insumos y alto nivel de sombra, y un monocultivo con altos insumos y bajo nivel de sombra. Encontramos que el policultivo de sombra tenía una diversidad significativamente mayor de epífitas en el café, con casi el doble del número total de especies registradas, en promedio un 76 % más de especies por planta de café, y cinco veces más individuos de orquídeas y bromelias. La equidad de las comunidades de cada finca también fue distinta, siendo mayor en el policultivo sombreado. Nuestra evaluación de posibles factores de manejo reveló un impacto positivo de la cobertura del dosel y la altura de las plantas de café sobre la riqueza y abundancia de especies de epífitas, y un impacto negativo de la distancia al parche de bosque más cercano sobre la riqueza de especies en el policultivo sombreada, lo que ilustra la importancia de comprender los efectos del manejo tanto a escala local como del paisaje. En conjunto, nuestros resultados muestran cómo la diversidad de epífitas en plantas de café puede reducirse significativamente por las prácticas de intensificación del cultivo, y muestran además el potencial del manejo agroforestal sostenible para la conservación de la biodiversidad.","2026-05-01","2026-02-14 04:37:21","2026-02-14 04:37:21","2026-02-14 04:37:21","110249","","","401","","Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/PPLSSLFI/Morris et al. - 2026 - Agricultural intensification associated with significant reduction in epiphyte diversity on coffee p.pdf; /Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/PZM5KRW2/S0167880926000368.html","","","Agricultural intensification; Agroforestry; Coffee; Epiphytes; Farm management; Local-landscape factors; Tropical montane cloud forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality, were higher in tree islands compared to conventionally managed oil palm. Larger tree islands led to larger gains in multidiversity through changes in vegetation structure. Furthermore, tree enrichment did not decrease landscape-scale oil palm yield. Our results demonstrate that enriching oil palm-dominated landscapes with tree islands is a promising ecological restoration strategy, yet should not replace the protection of remaining forests.","2023-06","2023-03-22 20:56:49","2026-02-14 04:45:16","2026-02-14 04:44:06","316-321","","7964","618","","","","","","","","Nature Publishing Group","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","","","/Users/kevinl/Zotero/storage/3B8I5J5W/Zemp et al. - 2023 - Tree islands enhance biodiversity and functioning in oil palm landscapes.pdf","","","Biodiversity; Ecosystem ecology; Ecosystem services; Restoration ecology; Tropical ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
