I am a landscape- and agro-ecologist who is also trained in landscape architecture. I use my unique background to take an encompassing approach to research in landscape systems that includes aspects of agriculture, ecology, and public health, as well as a data-driven approach to ecological landscape design. My work aims to make environmental data accessible and actionable for communities and decision makers. I have expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistical analysis, and data visualization, as well as hands-on experience in ecological restoration, stewardship, and landscape design.

Through research and consulting work, I am dedicated to creating landscapes that meet human and ecological needs and foster resilient communities for people and nature.
