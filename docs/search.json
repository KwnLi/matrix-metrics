    "text": "I am a landscape- and agro-ecologist who is also trained in landscape architecture. I use my unique background to take an encompassing approach to research in landscape systems that includes aspects of agriculture, ecology, and public health, as well as a data-driven approach to ecological landscape design. My work aims to make environmental data accessible and actionable for communities and decision makers. I have expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistical analysis, and data visualization, as well as hands-on experience in ecological restoration, stewardship, and landscape design.\nThrough research and consulting work, I am dedicated to creating landscapes that meet human and ecological needs and foster resilient communities for people and nature."

    "text": "This site is still under construction. Come back soon for updates!\nEcological and social systems are critically interconnected in the landscape. In the vocabulary of landscape and agro-ecology, the landscape matrix describes parts of the landscape where people and nature interact. As a scientist and researcher, I value metrics as tools for quantifying the observable world around me in hopes of better understanding it. Matrix metrics has a nice alliterative ring to it.\nAs a landscape ecologist, I want to understand certain things about the landscape matrix – how we humans impact it, how the natural systems within it support us, and how we can support it. I am committed to using my expertise to find solutions that support a sustainable and functioning matrix, which are responsive to local communities, support people’s health and needs, and restore natural systems.\n\nMy areas of expertise\n\nLandscape ecology and agroecology\nEcological Landscape Planning and Design\nEcoSpatial Statistics\nGeospatial Analysis"
