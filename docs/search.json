My ongoing work seeks to better understand what floral resources are available to pollinators over space and time. I am developing projects that use citizen science data and satellite imagery to map floral communities and use existing long-term datasets from the US Forest Service to model underappreciated forest-based floral resources.\n\n\nBeeSpatial\nI develop the web application BeeSpatial as a research-focused complement to Beescape, an interactive map-based application that helps users assess landscape quality for supporting bees and other pollinators. BeeSpatial helps researchers access a trove of habitat and environmental landscape data, including predicted seasonal floral resources, bee nesting habitat, land cover, and climate variables.\n\n\nModeling Landscape Agroecosystem Services\n\nMy recently published work shows that distinct aspects of landscape composition and configuration maximize different ecosystem services through nonlinear relationships, suggesting thresholds or tipping points (Li and Goslee 2025, Landscape Ecol)."
