My research investigates how ecology and society interact in a landscape context. I use quantitative methods to support sustainable and equitable solutions that seek to integrate human activity within the larger landscape system, with a goal of fulfilling peopleâ€™s needs while fostering conservation and restoration of natural ecosystems.

## Landscape ecosystem functions and services

-   Distance from forest effects

-   Wildflower strips ecosystem services

-   Pollinator resource connectivity and continuity

## Data tools for environmental research and planning

-   BeeSpatial

-   bioaccessibility modeling tool

-   forest floral resource phenology modeling

## Disruption and restoration of landscape systems

-   effects of islands on trophic connections

-   critical transitions are ecological surprises - coffee rust

-
